# gaiauncertainties

This script shows a way of getting uncertanties in 6 dimensional phase space using Gaia data and the correlations between the observables.

It is in no way pretty, but it might give an idea of what to do and how to get uncertainties in galacic coordinates or velocities using gaia and Astropy.
